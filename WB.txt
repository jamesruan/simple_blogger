\h1{About the Western Blot}

\h2{Introduction}

The western blot (sometimes called the protein immunoblot) is a widely accepted analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract.

This western blot is mainly divided into 4 steps:
\list#{
	\*  \toanchor{Sample preparation}
	\*  \toanchor{Gel electrophoresis}
	\*  \toanchor{Transfer}
	\*  \toanchor{Antibody staining}
}

\h4{The lysis buffer}

Stored at 4°C for several weeks.

Compatibility for downstream application




Nonidet-P40 (NP40) buffer
\list*{
	\* 150 mM NaCl
	\* 1.0% NP-40
	\* 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0
	\* Protease Inhibitors
}
\alert[info]{Triton X-100 can be used with similar results. Useful variations include lowering the detergent concentration, raising the salt concentration, or switching to other detergents such as saponin, digitonin, or CHAPS.}


m cultured cell}
\list#{
        \*  replace the culture matrix with ice-cold PBS
        \*  add ice-cold lysis buffer
}

\h4{From tissue}

RIPA buffer (Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay buffer)
\list*{
	\* 150 mM NaCl
	\* 1.0% NP-40 or 0.1% Triton X-100
	\* 0.5% sodium deoxycholate
	\* 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate)
	\* 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0
	\* Protease Inhibitors
}
This buffer is more denaturing than NP-40 or Triton X-100 lysis buffer because it contains the ionic detergents SDS and sodium deoxycholate as active constituents and is particularly \emphasis{useful for disruption of nuclear membranes} in the preparation of nuclear extracts. The RIPA buffer gives low background but can denature kinases. It will disrupt protein-protein interactions and may 
therefore be problematic for immunoprecipitations/pull down assays. 

Tris-HCl buffer:
\list*{
	\* 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5
	\* Protease Inhibitors
}

Tris-Triton buffer:
\list*{
	\* 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 
	\* 100 mM NaCl 
	\* 1 mM EDTA 
	\* 1 mM EGTA 
	\* 1% Triton X-100 
	\* 10% glycerol 
	\* 0.1% SDS 
	\* 0.5% deoxycholate 
	\* Protease Inhibitors
}

\h4{From cultured cell}

\list#{
	\* replace the culture matrix with ice-cold PBS then aspirate it 
	\* add ice-cold lysis buffer 1ml for 10e7 cell / 10cm dish / 150cm² flask / 1mg cell
	\* scrape adherent cell (plastic scraper) and transfer to microfuge tube
	\* agitate the mixture (30min)
	\* centrifuge and get the supernant
	\* get the protein concentration
}

\h4{From tissue}

\list#{
    \* dissect the tissue on ice
    \* place it in round-bottom microfuge tubes or Eppendorf tubes and immerse in liquid nitrogen to "snap freeze"
    \* store at -80°C or immediate homogenization: 5mg tissue for 1ml lysis buffer( including rinse the blade ).
    \* agitate the mixture (2h)
	\* centrifuge and get the supernant
	\* get the protein concentration
}


\h3{Denaturing and reducing sample}

SDS and heating for denaturing and is required for SDS-PAGE. Heating with 95°C for 5min or 70°C for 5-10min if Multi-pass membrande protein. Vortex before and after heating to maximize resolution.

ß-mercaptoethanol or Dithiothreitol(DTT) for reducing the disulphide bridges.

Typical loading buffer:

Laemmli buffer 2X: (4X or 6X also possible)
\list*{
    \* 4% SDS
    \* 10% 2-mercaptoehtanol
    \* 20% glycerol
    \* 0.004% bromophenol blue
    \* 0.125 M Tris HCl
